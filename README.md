# Attendance List App

This is my first mobile app built with React Native. It's a simple attendance list application.
This app allows you to keep track of attendance by adding and removing names based on the current day. 
It provides a user-friendly interface with basic core components such as View, TextInput, TouchableOpacity, and FlatList.

## Technologies Used
- React Native
- TypeScript
- useState hook
- Basic core components: View, TextInput, TouchableOpacity, FlatList, Alert

## Features
- Add names to the attendance list.
- Remove names from the attendance list.
- Automatically display the current day's attendance list.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Run the app using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
5. The app should open in your default mobile device emulator or on your connected physical device.
6. Start adding names to the attendance list by typing in the TextInput field and pressing the "Add" button.
7. To remove a name, simply press on the name in the list and confirm the removal in the alert dialog.
